# Expense Tracker made using _React.js_

[Check the Live Working demo here!](https://jayanta-expense-tracker.netlify.app/)

### If you want to run the project on your system -

> 1. Fork the project to your own repo and clone it.
> 2. Run `npm install` to install all the node modules required.
> 3. Run `npm start` to view to project on a local server

Made following a course which helped me gain the foundations of React.
